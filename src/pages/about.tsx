          It’s hard to encapsulate what makes or breaks an NFT project. Extremely well thought out concepts with
          perfectly capable helmsmen can spend months trying to gain traction, while the most basic ideas can flourish &
          sell out in a matter of seconds. Why?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hype & Marketing are obvious answers, and will often be the primary catalyst to propel a project into an
          overnight success, but very VERY few projects can maintain this momentum.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent case-study worth looking at is the “Bored Ape Yacht Club”. One could argue that it’s success can be
          boiled down to the aesthetics & that people just “like the art”, but there are countless projects that
          preceded Apes with very similar credentials that have simply faded into obscurity. My brief foray into the
          club made one thing very obvious to me, BAYC is far more than a collection of images, it truly is a movement.

          How does one start a movement? First you need a concept or belief that people can rally behind. Then you need
          a means for those people to interact & share ideas, and finally you need to reward those that support the
          cause in order to entice new members & grow the community.

          We greet each other politely every morning, we say it back to one and other. This is not a new concept, but is
          is one that has been lost in the realms of social media.
        </p>
        <p>The NFT community looked to change that, and Twitter is a better place for it.</p>

        <p>
          So now what? The first step for new members is to join the Discord, this is where most of the discussions take
          place. The club is very much in it’s infancy, with roughly 70 members to date (13/09/2021), but we have big
          plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the short term our goal is to make the gm. club an exclusive area where polite & passionate people can gain
          an edge over the market, sharing ideas, winning prizes & discussing drops. But our ultimate goal is much
          greater than this, we want to reward members with actual value.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would mostly revolve around the gmDAO, a treasury fund that could be deployed by the gm.embers for
          purposes that benefit the community. Some initial ideas for the treasury are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fractionalizaion of fine art (Punks, Apes, AB), distributed across all gm. holders</li>
          <li>
            Commissioning traditional/gen artist to create an exclusive collection to holders for free, with additional
            pieces being available for public mint. All proceeds would be reinvested into treasury
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To execute these ideas we would require some initial capital, and for this we also have ideas, but more on
          this later.
        </p>
        <p>For now, we hope to see you in the club soon & thanks for reading!</p>
